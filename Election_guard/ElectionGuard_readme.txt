 ElectionGuard DApp for detecting election fraud and anomalies using blockchain technology and ML predictions:
üîë Key Features
1. Dashboard

Real-time statistics on regions, anomalies, blockchain blocks, and ML accuracy
Interactive voter turnout visualizations
Regional election data table with flagged anomalies

2. Anomaly Detection

Automatic detection of suspicious patterns:

Turnout anomalies (>95% turnout)
Vote count mismatches (votes > registered voters)
Irregular statistical distributions (unusual variance)


Severity classification (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
Confidence scoring for each anomaly

3. ML Predictions (TensorFlow-based)

Neural network fraud probability scoring
Feature-based analysis:

Turnout rate patterns
Voter ratio analysis
Vote distribution variance


Risk classification (High/Medium/Low)
Feature importance visualization

4. Blockchain Ledger

Immutable vote recording
Block validation with hashing
Proof of Authority consensus
Transparent audit trail

üêç Python Backend Integration Guide
To integrate with a real Python backend using TensorFlow/PyTorch:
python# fraud_detection_ml.py
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from web3 import Web3

app = Flask(__name__)

# Load trained model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('election_fraud_model.h5')

class ElectionFraudDetector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('http://localhost:8545'))
        
    def preprocess_data(self, election_data):
        """Prepare features for ML model"""
        features = []
        for region in election_data:
            turnout = region['actualVotes'] / region['registeredVoters']
            variance = np.std(region['votes']) / np.mean(region['votes'])
            features.append([turnout, variance, len(region['votes'])])
        return np.array(features)
